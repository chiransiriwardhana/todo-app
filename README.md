# How to setup the project

use below commands and procedure to setup the project (if you don't have installed node.js and npm in local machine then install those first)

1. goto terminal and enter following command.

   ### `git clone https://github.com/chiransiriwardhana/todo-app.git`

2. open project folder using VS code

3. goto VS code terminal and enter below command to install all dependencies.
   
   ###  `npm install`  

4. then enter following command to start application

   ### `npm start`

5. After entering these commands open your favourite browser and enter http://localhost:3000/

6. Then you can see Application 

# Features of application

1. Redux Toolkit has been used for state management
2. Plain CSS has been used for styling the application.
3. There are two seperate tabs for completed and not completed/active tasks. Not completed tasks are in 'todo' tab and completed tasks are in 'completed' tab. you can delete tasks if they are completed in both tabs. Also you can send completed tasks to 'completed' tab after finishing. Then within completed tab also you can delete completed tasks if needed.
4. changes are note deleted after page refresh.
5. you can drag and drop high priority task to top to show them as first todos. 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
